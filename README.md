# Learning Data Science in Python

The notebooks in this directory are supplemental material for my Python data
science students, which I've written to fill in gaps in the available
materials.  You'll want to refer to my [Python data science curriculum](http://www.terran.us/articles/python_curriculum.html) to see how to best use these
documents.

You may also be interested in the [live notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tmelconian/python-datascience/tree/master/), which supports github-hosted documents.
